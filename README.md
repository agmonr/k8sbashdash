Small dashboard writen in bash for kubernetes.
It will display some info about your namepace.

* The script will mark restarted pods and not ready pods. 
* The scirprt has some basic support for changing the termninal size. 
* Was tested only under linux shells. 

The script is not using watch to refresh for better color supports.  

First early beta.
